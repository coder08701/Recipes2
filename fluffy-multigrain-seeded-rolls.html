    <h3>Light and airy rolls</h3>
    <p>These light and airy rolls are the perfect comfort food, along with a hearty bowl of soup. The addition of oats and seeds add interest and texture, making it a healthy choice too! My family enjoys these rolls all the time!</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<h5>Rolls</h5>
<ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons raw pumpkin seeds</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons raw sunflower seeds</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chia seeds</li>
    <li>1 and 1/2 tablespoons flax seeds</li>
    <li>7 grams instant dry yeast (see note)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup warm water</li>
    <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
    <li>1 and 1/4 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 cup white whole wheat flour</li>
    <li>4 (scant) cups high-gluten flour, divided</li>
    <li>1 beaten egg, for brushing</li>
    <li>2 cups water</li>
    <li>1 cup quick-cooking oats</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons margarine</li>
</ul>
<h5>Toppings</h5>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sunflowers seeds</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons black sesame seeds</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons flax seeds</li>
    <li>1 cup cool water, for soaking</li>
    
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Place two cups of water into a medium-sized pot and add oats and margarine. Bring to a boil and cook for about one minute, stirring to combine. Remove from heat and allow to cool until lukewarm.</li>
<li>Combine pumpkin, sunflower, chia, and flax seeds in a dry medium skillet and toast over medium heat, stirring, until lightly brown and starting to pop, five to seven minutes. Allow to cool.</li>
<li>Place the yeast and 1/3 cup warm water into the bowl of your mixer with the dough hook attached. Add the oat mixture, sugars, salt, seeds, whole-wheat flour, and three cups high-gluten flour. Knead until smooth, about seven to eight minutes. (Don’t worry if the dough appears dry at first, it will moisten once fully kneaded.)</li>
<li>Slowly add remaining cup of flour to the mixture and beat until fully incorporated. You should have a soft and slightly sticky dough. Place dough into a greased large bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about one hour.</li>
<li>While the dough is rising, place the seeds for the topping into one cup water to soak (so that they don’t burn while baking).</li>
<li>Punch dough down; allow to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Prepare two nine-inch (23-centimeter) round baking pans. Shape dough into 24 balls and place 12 balls into each baking pan. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).</li>
<li>When finished rising, brush the rolls with beaten egg. Drain the seeds through a mesh strainer. Shake out any excess water and sprinkle over the top of the dough.</li>
<li>Bake rolls until golden brown, 20–25 minutes. Remove from pans to wire racks.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: If you use active dry yeast and not instant, you will need to double the rising time.</p>
<p>Tip: You can easily add or swap out any of the seeds for other options such as dried cranberries or other dried fruit, hemp, poppy, or caraway. Be creative!</p>
